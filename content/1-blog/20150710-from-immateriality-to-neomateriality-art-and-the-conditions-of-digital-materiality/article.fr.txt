#Abstract

>This paper explores the evolution of materialities in the context of art and digital technologies and proposes “neomateriality” as a current condition of material and objecthood. It traces the evolution from dematerialization and the immaterial to hypermateriality and neomateriality as a term capturing various disruptions that introduce new aesthetic paradigms. The concept of neomateriality strives to describe an objecthood that incorporates networked digital technologies, and embeds, processes, and reflects back the data of humans and the environment, or reveals its own coded materiality and the way in which digital processes see our world.
