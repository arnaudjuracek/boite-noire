>The designers behind (link: http://www.catalogtree.net/ text: Catalogtree), Daniel Gross and Joris Maltha, collect enormous amounts of indigestible data and transform it into lucid images. These images tell stories that otherwise would be invisible.
>In 2006 they decided to portray a highway in their neighbourhood. This resulted in nine silk-screen posters, each portraying a different aspect of the road; such as traffic-intensity, accidents or traffic jams. 
>The clients of Catalogtree are mostly newspapers and magazines, but in 2010 they designed the graphics for an interactive documentary called Money & Speed made for iPad. Their visualizations superbly explain the shortest financial crash ever on wall street. For this project they won two Dutch Design Awards.
>Apart from all their commissioned work Catalogtree also take time to experiment. Inspired by the random patterns in nature they use tiny robots to imitate the behaviour of swarms.
