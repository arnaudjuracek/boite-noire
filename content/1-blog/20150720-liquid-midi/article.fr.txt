‘liquid MIDI’ by EJtech is an experimental textile interface for sonic interactions, exploring aesthetics and morphology in contemporary design. the technology is screen printed with electric paint from bare conductive directly onto a textile surface, then through an arduino micro controller communicates with the desired software, using MIDI protocol. this unique interaction with this textile interface allows the medium to become part of the message, where the interface becomes part of the process of creation itself.
